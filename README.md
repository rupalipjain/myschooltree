# My School Tree #
A Social Framework for Green Intiative

I know it's github, the  heaven for all geeks and this project is not about technology, but it is open source,
inspired by the fact that how communities has built such great softwares !


With increasing temperature and all other signs of global warming, we all wants to do something about it.
We as grown up adults somewhere in our hearts strongly feel the fact that, this is not the world we want to give to the future generations. 

We genuinely want to do something about it, but at times we simply can not find that first little step.

There are many NGOs, volunteers and other social workers who are doing great jobs to save our planet by keeping it green.

But we should not forget the fact, each one of us is contributing in producing carbon footprints then why only few to contribute when it comes to green initiatives. No matter how much we do it’s always less when it comes to curing the damage we have done to our mother earth.

This message has no commercial, political or any other publicity interest, rather it is an open source proposal of a framework which can be a little contribution to look after our mother.
 The mother nature is above any religion, cast, race, age and many more human made good and bad things.

This paper or presentation is a proposal of a framework which can potentially be adopted in any corner of the world.
This is an open initiative which means we all can improve the framework by mutual contributions of ideas and refinements towards mutual benefits.

## Outline of Framework ##

## My School Tree. ##

My School Tree is an idea of a framework, where key heroes are the local schools participating in local chapters. 
Let’s take an example, I am from a small village or a town and I would like to begin from my own home.
What I can think of is, I will start a Chapter of "My School Tree" in my own town and all the local schools participates in this chapter, despite their competitions they come together for one cause. Although competing for who has more green contribution is not a bad idea !

All such schools help to make their village, town or city greener by planting and maintaining more and more trees.

There are three major points to consider
 1. Motivation and Man power
 2. Availability of land where trees can be planted
 3. Supply of Trees and materials

I am trying to put a very high level ideas in each of these sections. I hope we all can contribute in below areas and can build something effective.

### 1 Motivation and Man Power ###
Not only for planting but to maintain it, we need strong motivation as well as man power.
Schools are where we are growing our future leaders. Is there a way we can link them to growing trees ?
May be, what if each kid or at least each class has a tree to plant and look after which grows along with the kids. Kids learn to feel connected to trees and environments.
Seeing a friend in tree can help tomorrow's leaders to think wisely for nurturing the mother nature. 
I am sure we all have observed kids who believe in some imaginary characters and superheroes. Why can’t we make them believe in an alive friend and superheroes - “Trees”.

As a mother If I have to make my kid be disciplined or committed about some good thing, I would prefer to make her a promise to her friend Tree.
For example, as a teacher can we encourage a kid to do well in certain subjects by making her/him to promise it to her/his  friend tree, who is growing along with her/him ?
 
The thought here is to link a purpose to the action.  

The needed manpower need not be the kids only but can be the parents too. 
In summary, can there be any idea which involves teachers, kids and parents with win win for all ?

### 2 Availability of land ###
School’s own land can be used and will be filled shortly with few classes or groups. There can be local government supports to avail more lands. 
There can be road dividers in city which can be used for planting. Possibilities are endless. More creative ideas are welcome !


### 3 Supply of Trees and Materials ###
Depending on geography and other economical aspects this might not be a big issue. Trees can be availed from local forest departments. Other materials can be made available by charity or support from local farmers. 
Please contribute your valuable creative ideas.
